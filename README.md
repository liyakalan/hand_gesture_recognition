# Hand Gesture Recognition

The project introduces an application using deep learning which uses the
concept of computer vision for Hand Gesture Recognition. The camera of the local machine is
activated in order to capture the images for the creation of the dataset. The dataset is then
converted into a model which is achieved by converting the captured images into sequences of
arrays using the MediaPipe technology. Further, the resulting model is trained using the
LSTM machine learning model and after that a test gesture is given to it and the system tries
to recognise it.
